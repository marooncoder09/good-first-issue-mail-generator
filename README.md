# Project Description: Generating and Sending Emails for "Good First Issue" Tagged Repositories

## Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

This project is focused on generating and sending emails to notify potential contributors about new repositories available on GitHub, tagged as "good first issue". 

The aim of this project is to make it easier for new contributors to get started with open source development by highlighting beginner-friendly issues that they can tackle. By automating the process of generating and sending these emails, we hope to make it simpler for maintainers to attract and retain new contributors.

Our code uses various programming languages and libraries to interact with the GitHub API, extract information about new "good first issue" tagged repositories, and generate personalized emails with the relevant details. We have also implemented security measures to ensure that users' information and credentials are protected.

Feel free to explore our code and contribute to this project to make it even better. We hope that our efforts will help to increase participation in open source and make the community more welcoming to newcomers.
